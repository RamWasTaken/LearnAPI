## how to create MERN app
1.Initialize a new Node.js project
``` npm init -y ```
this created a package.json file in the root of your project.

2.Install dependencies
``` npm install express mongoose cors nodemon ```

3: Create a new Vite project
``` npx create-vite@latest```
it will ask for some questions, answer them and it will create a new Vite project in the current directory.
also follows up with cd to myApp and npm install to install the dependencies.

* There was a folder created named myApp, which is the Vite project.
inside we have node_modules, public, src, and package.json.
so i deleted node_modules and package.json outside the myApp folder.

now folder structure is like myApp(consisting of node_modules, clientFolder which contains public and src folders , imoved them in there, server folder which will contain the server code)

Now we have a client folder which contains the Vite project and a server folder which will contain the server code.

Basic structre is done lets move on to the coding part.(check inside README.md) for coding parts.
